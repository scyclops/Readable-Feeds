"""A high-level cross-protocol url-grabber.

GENERAL ARGUMENTS (kwargs)

  Where possible, the module-level default is indicated, and legal
  values are provided.

  copy_local = 0   [0|1]

    ignored except for file:// urls, in which case it specifies
    whether urlgrab should still make a copy of the file, or simply
    point to the existing copy. The module level default for this
    option is 0.

  close_connection = 0   [0|1]

    tells URLGrabber to close the connection after a file has been
    transfered. This is ignored unless the download happens with the
    http keepalive handler (keepalive=1).  Otherwise, the connection
    is left open for further use. The module level default for this
    option is 0 (keepalive connections will not be closed).

  keepalive = 1   [0|1]

    specifies whether keepalive should be used for HTTP/1.1 servers
    that support it. The module level default for this option is 1
    (keepalive is enabled).

  progress_obj = None

    a class instance that supports the following methods:
      po.start(filename, url, basename, length, text)
      # length will be None if unknown
      po.update(read) # read == bytes read so far
      po.end()

  text = None
  
    specifies an alternativ text item in the beginning of the progress
    bar line. If not given, the basename of the file is used.

  throttle = 1.0

    a number - if it's an int, it's the bytes/second throttle limit.
    If it's a float, it is first multiplied by bandwidth.  If throttle
    == 0, throttling is disabled.  If None, the module-level default
    (which can be set on default_grabber.throttle) is used. See
    BANDWIDTH THROTTLING for more information.

  timeout = None

    a positive float expressing the number of seconds to wait for socket
    operations. If the value is None or 0.0, socket operations will block
    forever. Setting this option causes urlgrabber to call the settimeout
    method on the Socket object used for the request. See the Python
    documentation on settimeout for more information.
    http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/socket-objects.html

  bandwidth = 0

    the nominal max bandwidth in bytes/second.  If throttle is a float
    and bandwidth == 0, throttling is disabled.  If None, the
    module-level default (which can be set on
    default_grabber.bandwidth) is used. See BANDWIDTH THROTTLING for
    more information.

  range = None

    a tuple of the form (first_byte, last_byte) describing a byte
    range to retrieve. Either or both of the values may set to
    None. If first_byte is None, byte offset 0 is assumed. If
    last_byte is None, the last byte available is assumed. Note that
    the range specification is python-like in that (0,10) will yeild
    the first 10 bytes of the file.

    If set to None, no range will be used.
    
  reget = None   [None|'simple'|'check_timestamp']

    whether to attempt to reget a partially-downloaded file.  Reget
    only applies to .urlgrab and (obviously) only if there is a
    partially downloaded file.  Reget has two modes:

      'simple' -- the local file will always be trusted.  If there
        are 100 bytes in the local file, then the download will always
        begin 100 bytes into the requested file.

      'check_timestamp' -- the timestamp of the server file will be
        compared to the timestamp of the local file.  ONLY if the
        local file is newer than or the same age as the server file
        will reget be used.  If the server file is newer, or the
        timestamp is not returned, the entire file will be fetched.

    NOTE: urlgrabber can do very little to verify that the partial
    file on disk is identical to the beginning of the remote file.
    You may want to either employ a custom "checkfunc" or simply avoid
    using reget in situations where corruption is a concern.

  user_agent = 'urlgrabber/VERSION'

    a string, usually of the form 'AGENT/VERSION' that is provided to
    HTTP servers in the User-agent header. The module level default
    for this option is "urlgrabber/VERSION".

  http_headers = None

    a tuple of 2-tuples, each containing a header and value.  These
    will be used for http and https requests only.  For example, you
    can do
      http_headers = (('Pragma', 'no-cache'),)

  ftp_headers = None

    this is just like http_headers, but will be used for ftp requests.

  proxies = None

    a dictionary that maps protocol schemes to proxy hosts. For
    example, to use a proxy server on host "foo" port 3128 for http
    and https URLs:
      proxies={ 'http' : 'http://foo:3128', 'https' : 'http://foo:3128' }
    note that proxy authentication information may be provided using
    normal URL constructs:
      proxies={ 'http' : 'http://user:host@foo:3128' }
    Lastly, if proxies is None, the default environment settings will
    be used.

  prefix = None

    a url prefix that will be prepended to all requested urls.  For
    example:
      g = URLGrabber(prefix='http://foo.com/mirror/')
      g.urlgrab('some/file.txt')
      ## this will fetch 'http://foo.com/mirror/some/file.txt'
    This option exists primarily to allow identical behavior to
    MirrorGroup (and derived) instances.  Note: a '/' will be inserted
    if necessary, so you cannot specify a prefix that ends with a
    partial file or directory name.

  opener = None
  
    Overrides the default urllib2.OpenerDirector provided to urllib2
    when making requests.  This option exists so that the urllib2
    handler chain may be customized.  Note that the range, reget,
    proxy, and keepalive features require that custom handlers be
    provided to urllib2 in order to function properly.  If an opener
    option is provided, no attempt is made by urlgrabber to ensure
    chain integrity.  You are responsible for ensuring that any
    extension handlers are present if said features are required.
    
  data = None

    Only relevant for the HTTP family (and ignored for other
    protocols), this allows HTTP POSTs.  When the data kwarg is
    present (and not None), an HTTP request will automatically become
    a POST rather than GET.  This is done by direct passthrough to
    urllib2.  If you use this, you may also want to set the
    'Content-length' and 'Content-type' headers with the http_headers
    option.  Note that python 2.2 handles the case of these
    badly and if you do not use the proper case (shown here), your
    values will be overridden with the defaults.
    

RETRY RELATED ARGUMENTS

  retry = None

    the number of times to retry the grab before bailing.  If this is
    zero, it will retry forever. This was intentional... really, it
    was :). If this value is not supplied or is supplied but is None
    retrying does not occur.

  retrycodes = [-1,2,4,5,6,7]

    a sequence of errorcodes (values of e.errno) for which it should
    retry. See the doc on URLGrabError for more details on this.  You
    might consider modifying a copy of the default codes rather than
    building yours from scratch so that if the list is extended in the
    future (or one code is split into two) you can still enjoy the
    benefits of the default list.  You can do that with something like
    this:

      retrycodes = urlgrabber.grabber.URLGrabberOptions().retrycodes
      if 12 not in retrycodes:
          retrycodes.append(12)
      
  checkfunc = None

    a function to do additional checks. This defaults to None, which
    means no additional checking.  The function should simply return
    on a successful check.  It should raise URLGrabError on an
    unsuccessful check.  Raising of any other exception will be
    considered immediate failure and no retries will occur.

    If it raises URLGrabError, the error code will determine the retry
    behavior.  Negative error numbers are reserved for use by these
    passed in functions, so you can use many negative numbers for
    different types of failure.  By default, -1 results in a retry,
    but this can be customized with retrycodes.

    If you simply pass in a function, it will be given exactly one
    argument: a CallbackObject instance with the .url attribute
    defined and either .filename (for urlgrab) or .data (for urlread).
    For urlgrab, .filename is the name of the local file.  For
    urlread, .data is the actual string data.  If you need other
    arguments passed to the callback (program state of some sort), you
    can do so like this:

      checkfunc=(function, ('arg1', 2), {'kwarg': 3})

    if the downloaded file has filename /tmp/stuff, then this will
    result in this call (for urlgrab):

      function(obj, 'arg1', 2, kwarg=3)
      # obj.filename = '/tmp/stuff'
      # obj.url = 'http://foo.com/stuff'
      
    NOTE: both the "args" tuple and "kwargs" dict must be present if
    you use this syntax, but either (or both) can be empty.

  failure_callback = None

    The callback that gets called during retries when an attempt to
    fetch a file fails.  The syntax for specifying the callback is
    identical to checkfunc, except for the attributes defined in the
    CallbackObject instance.  The attributes for failure_callback are:

      exception = the raised exception
      url       = the url we're trying to fetch
      tries     = the number of tries so far (including this one)
      retry     = the value of the retry option

    The callback is present primarily to inform the calling program of
    the failure, but if it raises an exception (including the one it's
    passed) that exception will NOT be caught and will therefore cause
    future retries to be aborted.

    The callback is called for EVERY failure, including the last one.
    On the last try, the callback can raise an alternate exception,
    but it cannot (without severe trickiness) prevent the exception
    from being raised.

  interrupt_callback = None

    This callback is called if KeyboardInterrupt is received at any
    point in the transfer.  Basically, this callback can have three
    impacts on the fetch process based on the way it exits:

      1) raise no exception: the current fetch will be aborted, but
         any further retries will still take place

      2) raise a URLGrabError: if you're using a MirrorGroup, then
         this will prompt a failover to the next mirror according to
         the behavior of the MirrorGroup subclass.  It is recommended
         that you raise URLGrabError with code 15, 'user abort'.  If
         you are NOT using a MirrorGroup subclass, then this is the
         same as (3).

      3) raise some other exception (such as KeyboardInterrupt), which
         will not be caught at either the grabber or mirror levels.
         That is, it will be raised up all the way to the caller.

    This callback is very similar to failure_callback.  They are
    passed the same arguments, so you could use the same function for
    both.
      
  urlparser = URLParser()

    The URLParser class handles pre-processing of URLs, including
    auth-handling for user/pass encoded in http urls, file handing
    (that is, filenames not sent as a URL), and URL quoting.  If you
    want to override any of this behavior, you can pass in a
    replacement instance.  See also the 'quote' option.

  quote = None

    Whether or not to quote the path portion of a url.
      quote = 1    ->  quote the URLs (they're not quoted yet)
      quote = 0    ->  do not quote them (they're already quoted)
      quote = None ->  guess what to do

    This option only affects proper urls like 'file:///etc/passwd'; it
    does not affect 'raw' filenames like '/etc/passwd'.  The latter
    will always be quoted as they are converted to URLs.  Also, only
    the path part of a url is quoted.  If you need more fine-grained
    control, you should probably subclass URLParser and pass it in via
    the 'urlparser' option.

BANDWIDTH THROTTLING

  urlgrabber supports throttling via two values: throttle and
  bandwidth Between the two, you can either specify and absolute
  throttle threshold or specify a theshold as a fraction of maximum
  available bandwidth.

  throttle is a number - if it's an int, it's the bytes/second
  throttle limit.  If it's a float, it is first multiplied by
  bandwidth.  If throttle == 0, throttling is disabled.  If None, the
  module-level default (which can be set with set_throttle) is used.

  bandwidth is the nominal max bandwidth in bytes/second.  If throttle
  is a float and bandwidth == 0, throttling is disabled.  If None, the
  module-level default (which can be set with set_bandwidth) is used.

  THROTTLING EXAMPLES:

  Lets say you have a 100 Mbps connection.  This is (about) 10^8 bits
  per second, or 12,500,000 Bytes per second.  You have a number of
  throttling options:

  *) set_bandwidth(12500000); set_throttle(0.5) # throttle is a float

     This will limit urlgrab to use half of your available bandwidth.

  *) set_throttle(6250000) # throttle is an int

     This will also limit urlgrab to use half of your available
     bandwidth, regardless of what bandwidth is set to.

  *) set_throttle(6250000); set_throttle(1.0) # float

     Use half your bandwidth

  *) set_throttle(6250000); set_throttle(2.0) # float

    Use up to 12,500,000 Bytes per second (your nominal max bandwidth)

  *) set_throttle(6250000); set_throttle(0) # throttle = 0

     Disable throttling - this is more efficient than a very large
     throttle setting.

  *) set_throttle(0); set_throttle(1.0) # throttle is float, bandwidth = 0

     Disable throttling - this is the default when the module is loaded.

  SUGGESTED AUTHOR IMPLEMENTATION (THROTTLING)

  While this is flexible, it's not extremely obvious to the user.  I
  suggest you implement a float throttle as a percent to make the
  distinction between absolute and relative throttling very explicit.

  Also, you may want to convert the units to something more convenient
  than bytes/second, such as kbps or kB/s, etc.
